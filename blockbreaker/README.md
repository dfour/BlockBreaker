## Blockbreaker

Blockbreaker is a desktop brick breaking game that uses the lbgdx framework and box2d. Inspired by the GameBoy game Brick Breaker. 

## Game 

The aim of the game is to remove the bricks from their location by hitting them with a wrecking ball.
You have a limited supply of wrecking balls and they can be lost if they go out of the play area.
You can then score points by collection the bricks that fall loose with the paddle.


## Motivation

This project was originally a test for the Box2D lights extension. A lot of work was put into this test and ended up being a fun game to develop and play.
After testing Box2D lights several features were added to increase the playability of this game including a level system, power ups and score system.
